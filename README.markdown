mRequires - Median JS loader and builder
========================================

mRequires is a JavaScipt build system used internally at [Median][].

It provides dynamic loading of JavaScript files at development time
and concatenation of all the code into one big JavaScript file for
deployment.

It also lacks any decent documentation.  Read the source code instead.

Requirements
------------

To run the mrequires.rb script, default Ruby installation should be
enough.

To run unit tests you need [rubygems][] and [mocha][].
